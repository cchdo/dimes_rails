Ship: R/V Roger Revelle<br><br>
<p>Jim Ledwell, of WHOI, is Chief Scientist. His interests are in stirring and mixing and how these affect the circulation and ecology of the ocean. He has participated in several large tracer release experiments: in the North Atlantic thermocline, the deep Brazil Basin, the Greenland Sea, and in a salt finger "staircase" in the upper ocean east of Barbados, and in several small ones: in the Southern California Basins, on the New England continental shelf, in the seasonal thermocline of the Sargasso Sea, and at the crest of the East Pacific Rise near 10 N. DIMES is the most ambitious and most complete study of stirring, mixing, and dynamics of the ocean of all of these.</p> 
 
<p>Peter Lazarevich is a research scientist at The Florida State University, where he has been for 6 years. He has been studying oceanography and attending research cruises for the past 10 years, with cruises to such places as the Southern Ocean, Arctic Sea, North Atlantic Ocean, and the South China Sea. His primary research interest is Lagrangian methods, using surface drifters and subsurface floats to track water motion and circulation features. Aboard the R/V Revelle, Peter will deploy 75 acoustically-tracked floats into currents that will carry them towards and through the Drake Passage.</p> 
 
<p>Brian Guest is a Senior Engineering Assistant at WHOI. He started working at WHOI in 1983 and has participated in more than 50 research cruises including descending to 2600 meters in the deep submergence vehicle Alvin. Primary responsibilities for the DIMES project are directing sound source mooring deployments, RAFOS floats prep and deployment, SOLO floats, tracer injection and sampling systems configuration, and shearmeter prep and deployment.</p> 
 
<p>Stew is the technician responsible for the software of the tracer injection and sampling system. This system,including automation of the winch, control the injection and sampling system within 1-2 meters of a target surface. His "day job" is as the primary data analyst and archivist for Taro Takahashi at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, studying ocean Carbon chemistry. He is also a retired US Coast Guard Officer who lives on and operates a former USCG 82 foot Patrol Boat in NY Harbor for the USCG Auxiliary.</p> 
 
<p>Leah Houghton is a Research Associate at WHOI, dividing her time between the Biology and AOP&E Departments. She performs chemical analyses in both departments using GC and Mass Spectrometry instruments. She has worked with Jim Ledwell on several of his tracer experiments. On this trip her primary responsibility is GC analysis of water samples.</p> 
 
<p>Cindy Sellers has been a Research Associate at WHOI for 20 years where she supports several scientists in the Ocean Acoustics Lab(OAL) and the Coastal and Ocean Fluid Dynamics Lab(COFDL) doing data collection, analysis, and display. She has worked with Jim Ledwell on several of his tracer experiments. On this trip her responsibilities include data archiving and analysis as well as CTD, injection and sampling watches.</p> 
 
<p>Ryan Abernathey is a Ph.D. student in the MIT program on Atmosphere, Ocean, and Climate. His research focuses on the spatial variations of isopycnal mixing by mesoscale eddies in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the role this mixing plays in the general circulation. After reading about the Southern Ocean for several years from the comfort of Cambridge, he is excited to have the opportunity to see it up-close and personal. When not working on deck, he can be found in his cabin playing the Irish whistle. 
 
<p>Cimarron Wortham is a third-year graduate student in the MIT/WHOI Joint Program in Physical Oceanography. His current research, advised by Carl Wunsch, involves using satellite altimetry and other observations to study ocean variability, a subject that usually allows him to stay comfortably far from the pitching and rolling of the actual ocean. During the DIMES cruise, he is responsible for monitoring and analyzing data from the Hydrographic Doppler Sonar System and Doppler Volume Sampler current meters. Additionally, he will assist with mooring deployment, tracer injection, and tracer sampling.</p> 
 
<p>Magdalena Carranza is completing her undergraduate degree in physical oceanography at University of Buenos Aires, Argentina. She is interested in upper ocean dynamics and the interaction between physical and biological processes. Her goal is to understand how the bio-optical cycle is driven by the physical processes and the circulation including the response to the atmospheric forcing in frontal regions. She is intereseted in understanding small and mesoscale processes, the way these affect the large scale ocean circulation and climate. She plans to pursue a PhD in physical oceanography and anticipates that participating in the DIMES field program will have a great impact in her future research interests and curiosities.</p> 
 
<p>Uriel Zajaczkovski is a student of Physical Oceanography at University of Buenos Aires, Argentina. He is finishing his thesis on mapping horizontal diffusivities and their relation to the general circulation of the South Atlantic using satellite-tracked surface drifters. He currently holds an undergraduate research fellowship awarded by the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research and a teaching assistantship at UBA. His interests are (i) tracer dispersion and Lagrangian measurements and (ii) large-scale ocean circulation and its low frequency variability. In his spare time, Uriel enjoys travelling, scuba diving and getting on board long and cold research cruises!</p> 
 
<p>Byron Kilbourne is a graduate student in Physical Oceanography working with James Girton at UW APL. His interests are in small scale vertical eddies and mixing in the Southern Ocean. Byron will deploy three EM-APEX floats in the first cruise of DIMES.</p> 
 
<p>My work is dedicated to the observation and modeling of the ocean circulation through different methods and techniques. I started in the early days with ocean-atmosphere box models, followed by studies of the equatorial and southern Atlantic Ocean western boundary layer using inverse models, then to look at the deep and intermediate circulation in the Gulf of Mexico using profiling floats. I focus nowadays on the influence of the high latitudes on the global thermohaline conveyor belt. I have also interests in oceanographic instrumentation and took part in several research cruises all over the world. In the last years I have joined the modeling world and run numerical models on cluster nodes. I am part of the Current Meter Facility at Florida State University.</p> 

 
<p>Jon C. Meyer has been working with computers his entire professional career. In 2006, he took that career to sea, joining Shipboard Technical Support at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. He has seen all 7 continents and 6 oceans courtesy of SIO. He enjoys playing guitar, computers that work, and calm seas.</p> 

 
<p>Meghan Donohue is a research marine technician aka Restech at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. I work on all four of SIOs ships running the deck, maintaining the labs, and acting as liaison between crew and science. I majored in Marine Science Physics at University of San Diego. And I got my mates license from Maine Maritime Academy.</p> 
 
<p>David Murline, Captain of R/V Roger Revelle Scripps Institution of Oceanography. My interest is keeping everyone aboard the ship safe while making sure the scientific party makes the most of their voyage by utilizing the ships resources to the max! I have worked at Scripps since 1984 starting as an AB Seaman and have sailed as a relief Captain since 1996. I am passionate about learning everything I can from the sea and supporting science. I have been fortunate to work at Scripps for close to 25 years, travel the world, surf/dive/fish some of the most exotic places on the planet and meet quite a few interesting characters along the way! When off the ship I live in San Diego with my wife Valerie and daughter Sarah, we also have a son Chris and grandson Luke who live in Charleston. We all enjoy spending our vacations together playing in the ocean.</p>
