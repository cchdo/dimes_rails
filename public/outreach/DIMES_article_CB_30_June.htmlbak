water 1300 meters below the surface of the Southern Ocean. They plan
to follow the tracer patch for at least the next three years. The
Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) will carry it eastward through
Drake Passage, but it will behave somewhat as cream does as it is
stirred into coffee, not like a neat package moving in a straight
line. It&rsquo;s precisely this messiness that interests the
scientists participating in the Diapycnal and Isopycnal Mixing
Experiment in the Southern Ocean (DIMES). This international effort,
whose principal investigators include BAS&rsquo; Mike Meredith and
Emily Shuckburgh, will enormously increase our knowledge of the
Southern Ocean&rsquo;s powerful and complicated circulation and its
disproportionate influence on the world&rsquo;s climate.

Some of the innovative technology DIMES investigators will deploy in
the Southern Ocean. In addition to these techniques, they will also
employ more conventional oceanographic methods, including
hydrographic and velocity profiling from research vessels,
high-resolution numerical modelling, and the use of satellite
altimeters.</P>

kilograms of tracer and scores of floats can accomplish</B></P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All these
instruments represent an investment too big for one institution or
even one country to make. Over the next four austral summers the UK
will lead three research cruises and the US four. Besides BAS, the
National Oceanography Centre, the University of East Anglia, and the
Scottish Association for Marine Science are involved, along with four
US institutions (Florida State University, the University of
California at San Diego, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,
and the University of Washington). Yet the point, according to BAS&rsquo;
Mike Meredith, is not to &lsquo;vastly amplify the data archives&mdash;it&rsquo;s
to address some of the major unknowns, by targeting specific, poorly
understood processes. If it works, it will really change the way we
think about the Southern Ocean and in turn the world ocean
circulation.&rsquo;</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ultimately,
data from DIMES will improve our understanding of ocean mixing&mdash;and
of how best to represent that mixing in the computer climate models
we use to predict the Earth system&rsquo;s response to change. To
understand how, it helps to place the project within a decades-long
series of improvements to climate models. As recently as the 1980s,
most models represented the ocean as a &lsquo;slab&rsquo; that
exchanged water with the rest of the Earth system but did not
circulate. Only a few of the best models could reproduce the work the
ocean does in transporting heat between the equator and the poles and
exchanging heat and water with the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More
powerful computers and a fuller knowledge of global ocean circulation
have made for rapid advances. A typical &lsquo;coupled&rsquo;
atmosphere-ocean global climate model, the UK Hadley Centre&rsquo;s
HadCM3, includes 20 vertical layers in its ocean. They also can
represent the climate system at higher horizontal resolution (1.25
degree each of latitude and longitude for HadCM3) &ndash; and
progress is continually being made.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As a
result, models have become better at describing processes like the
meridional overturning circulation (MOC) of the world ocean, one of
the fundamental determinants of the planet&rsquo;s climate. They
still, however, can only approximate rather than precisely reproduce
eddies in the ocean&mdash;the rough equivalent of atmospheric weather
systems. Ocean eddies come with diameters in the tens of kilometres,
as compared with hundreds or thousands for their counterparts in the
atmosphere. Compared with huge jets like the ACC, eddies&rsquo;
contribution to ocean circulation might seem like the equivalent of
pocket change, but DIMES scientists have reason to believe they
matter much more than that, and indeed that we cannot fully
understand the Southern Ocean limb of the MOC without understanding
eddies. The connection takes a little explaining.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Like the
North Atlantic, the Southern Ocean plays a pivotal role in the MOC as
the site of overturning of surface and abyssal waters. Water masses
formed in the North Atlantic, having travelled south through the deep
ocean, rise above the denser Antarctic Bottom Water, and then are
returned northward both near the surface and also far below: 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><IMG SRC="DIMES_article_CB_30_June_html_4f6f149c.png" NAME="Graphic5" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=430 HEIGHT=208 BORDER=0></P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Between
coloured zones in the figure lie what oceanographers call &lsquo;surfaces&rsquo;
of constant density, or isopycnals. Upwelling tends to occur along
isopycnals, and this vertical motion is believed to be key in closing
the ocean&rsquo;s overturning circulation. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Significantly,
however, the Southern Ocean&rsquo;s version of overturning looks
completely different from the North Atlantic&rsquo;s, above all
because of the ACC. At the latitude of Drake Passage, the ACC circles
the planet uninterrupted, thus uniquely connecting the Atlantic,
Pacific, and Indian oceans with each other. According to Dr. Alberto
Naveira Garabato of the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton,
the lead UK investigator for DIMES, &lsquo;The ACC makes the physics
of the Southern Ocean different from anywhere else, and also harder
to understand.&rsquo;</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The
steeply &lsquo;tilted&rsquo; isopycnals of the ACC contain potential
energy that can be released by eddies. These form as a consequence of
the instabilities in any jet on a rotating planet. Oceanographers
think their action in the Southern Ocean, combined with the
wind-driven circulation shown in the figure above, produces the
meridional (north-south) transport of water, salt, and heat. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At well as
studying upwelling, scientists have to consider the other daunting
technical term in DIMES&rsquo; name: diapycnal. While isopycnal
mixing involves movement <I>along</I> isopycnals (upwelling, for
instance), diapycnal processes mix water <I>across</I> isopycnals.
This can happen through mechanisms that involve eddies and also
internal waves&mdash;vertical or horizontal waves in the interior,
rather than on the surface, of the ocean. In the ACC, diapycnal
mixing effectively &lsquo;relaxes&rsquo; the tilting isopycnals and
counteracts the meridional fluxes necessary for Southern Ocean
overturning. So getting the balance between the two types of mixing
right in climate models matters for more than academic reasons. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Understanding
how they set the rate and structure of the overturning will allow us
to build models that can better predict the ocean circulation&rsquo;s
response to atmospheric climate change, and the resulting feedbacks
from the ocean to the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One aim of
the research &ldquo;cruises&rdquo; (if the word really applies to
people working in shifts around the clock in some of the roughest
ocean on earth) is to test what scientists call &lsquo;the null
hypothesis&rsquo;: in this case, &lsquo;that there is insufficient
mixing at mid depth in the Southern Ocean, where mixing ought to be
enhanced over most places in the ocean, to affect the global MOC
significantly,&rsquo; as Dr Naveira Garabato put it. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Indirect
measures of how this part of the Southern Ocean behaves have given
intriguing hints that diapycnal mixing plays a larger role than has
been assumed, especially in areas with rough bottom topography. Only
a comprehensive set of direct observations, historically sparse in
such a remote and inhospitable part of the ocean, can take modelling
of the ACC and overturning circulation a step further. In turn,
inverse modelling&mdash;using the data to infer the patterns of
circulation that produced those results&mdash;will form an essential
component of DIMES in interpreting those observations. The
combination of observational techniques, modelling and theoretical
considerations gives DIMES a chance to fundamentally improve our
concepts of how the Southern Ocean works, and why it is so important
for planetary climate as a whole.</P>
