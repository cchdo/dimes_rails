<h3>DIMES 2010 Investigator Meeting</h3>
<br>
Information about the meeting (as of 10 August 2010):<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Draft Agenda:</span>&nbsp; <a
 href="/DIMES_2010_meeting/DIMES_2010_v4.pdf">Posted here.</a> The preliminary schedule
likely omits some groups who may have preliminary results to
share, and not all speakers are aware that they are on the docket. This
is a good time, if you'd like to suggest shifts to the schedule.
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Travel Arrangements:</span>&nbsp; If
you have not already done so, now is also a great time to make travel
arrangements.&nbsp; DIMES meeting attendees are welcome to take
advantage of the block of hotel rooms that is being held at both the
Millennium and the Marriott for the CLIVAR workshop and WGOMD:

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Head Count:</span>&nbsp; At the moment
we don't think that we need a formal registration for the DIMES
meeting, but once you know that you're attending (or how many people in
your group are attending), please e-mail Kevin Speer <a
 class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:kspeer@fsu.edu">&lt;kspeer@fsu.edu&gt;</a>
so that he can track numbers.
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Decadal Predictability Workshop:</span>&nbsp;
If you are planning to attend the <a href="http://www.joss.ucar.edu/events/2010/clivar_wgomd_gsop/index.html#gsop">"CLIVAR/WGOMD/GSOP Workshop on
Decadal Variability, Predictability and Prediction: Understanding the
Role of the Ocean"</a> that precedes our meeting, please be sure to
register.
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIMES Meeting Organization:</span>&nbsp;
The DIMES meeting is structured with progress reports Friday morning, a
joint session with the Working Group on Ocean Model Development Friday
afternoon, discussion of upcoming UK cruises Saturday morning, and
break-out sessions to address specific project planning issues Saturday
afternoon.&nbsp; The agenda includes some potential discussion
questions, but almost certainly omits important topics, so please share
your thoughts so we can get things added in.
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Posters:&nbsp;</span> At lunchtime on
Friday we will have some time to view posters. &nbsp;This is a good
opportunity to share preliminary results or simply to recycle a poster
from another meeting.&nbsp; Let us know if you have a poster to
display, so that we can request an appropriate number of boards and
make up a list of poster titles.
